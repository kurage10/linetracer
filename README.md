# LookUpGate
## Do not merge this branch!
- This version is used to test parameters on the second trial.
- The robot now can pass the gate twice.
- Next, we will add a line trace function to make sure he always runs along the line.

See [lookup](https://github.com/kurage10/linetracer/tree/lookup) for the newest version.
